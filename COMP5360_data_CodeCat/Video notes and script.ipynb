    "Intro:\n",
    "- Fanfiction reading and writing is a popular pastime for many. ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goals:\n",
    "- We want to find what are the most popular fics, what contributes to popularity (rating level, number of comments, etc)\n",
    "- ...\n",
    "- We wanted to make a natural language learning model that could be used to check if it could guess the tag type based on the name of the tag alone. For ex: \"Ryan Ross\", \"Sean Bean\", and \"Jon Walker\" are character tags while \"Lord of the Rings RPF\" is a fandom tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ethical concerns:\n",
    "- Many fanfiction writers don't want their work to become part of a language learning program that will be used to duplicate their work. \n",
    "#### TODO: do we need to have just the top ethical concern or do we need to bring up the stigma around fanfics or just mention it in the findings?\n",
    "- There is a stigma that all fanfics are just pornographic works and our analysis could confirm this stigma.\n",
    "\n",
    "Processing:\n",
    "- Reddit user, theCodeCat, scraped data from AO3 and obtained approximately 6 million different works from it. We are using this data...\n",
    "- ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Findings:\n",
    "- Our results show that the most popular mediums of fanfiction are more explicit, the vast majority (more than ...% of works) are not explicit. ... \n",
    "- ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Final comments:\n",
    "- Fanfiction is a great pastime that has a wide variety of options for people to enjoy. While ... is true, there are still ..."
